**July, the 1st -> OHT is now cross-platform and works both in Linux (automatic preload) and Windows (using manual preload). There is one feature to implement: make "preload" to work in Windows. If you want to contribute, just email me or [continue reading here](https://github.com/pedromateo/openhmitester/issues/10)**

---

"Open HMI Tester" or OHT is an application framework for the development of **GUI testing tools**. It uses real-time
GUI **introspection** to capture and simulate **real user interaction**, which enhances
robustness and tolerance to changes during testing stage.

OHT provides a **cross-platform, open design** to support major event-based GUI platforms. Furthermore,
it can be integrated into ongoing and legacy developments due to it being **not code-intrusive**.
As a result, the framework provides an adaptable, extensible, scalable,
and **robust basis** to support the automation of GUI testing processes.

OHT is open-source and ready to use. It is cross-platform as well. Versions working in **Qt-Linux** and **Qt-Windows** environments are provided in this repository.

# Requirements / Compile & run OHT

OHT compiles with many different combinations of Qt and Boost libraries. Anyway, the authors suggest using:
- Qt v5.x (we are using Qt 5.5)

    sudo apt-get install qt5-default qt5-qmake

- Boost 1.60 or higher

    sudo apt-get install libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-serialization-dev

To build the project manually from Qt Creator (http://www.qt.io/ide/, recommended), follow these steps:

1. Open the `build_all_*.po` project.
2. Build `qt_*_hmi_tester` project.
3. Build `qt_*_lib_preload` project.

`*` means the operating system we are building OHT for.

Moreover, an Ansible script (https://www.ansible.com/) is provided to compile and run OHT automatically. It automates:

- installing requirements/dependencies
- downloading this repository
- compiling sources
- run HMI Tester (the testing app of OHT)

To execute it, just copy the file `download_compile_run.ansible.yml` to an empty directory and execute the following command:

    ansible-playbook -i "localhost," -c local ansible_ubuntu.yml -K

# OHT in action

## Recording and playing desktop test cases

With OHT you can create test cases for your application. Then, test cases can be replayed one by one, or all in a row.

## Recording and playing web test cases

With OHT you can create test cases for your webapp. Then, test cases can be replayed one by one, or all in a row.

OHT provides a free, easy and fast way to test your web, as well as to automate actions.

Note that this might produce unexpected results, as in the current implementation of the OHT, the test is recorded in the browser, not in the web page. We are working hard to provide a robust web-testing experience.

## Cross-platform experiment

With OHT you can create test cases in Windows and play them into the same application compiled in Linux, and vice versa. Cross-platform testing is one of the strengths of OHT.

## Robustness experiment

OHT can foresee missing GUI widgets, thus no actions will be executed for them.

# Logs in the AUT for debug actions

Two logs are generated with the standard and error output of the Application Under Test (AUT):
* oht_aut_stdout.log
* oht_aut_stderr.log

They are located in the same directory where the OHT binary is located. This decision was taken in order to use a cross-platform location.

Please, note that lib_preload output is also included in these log files.

## How to adapt OHT to Windows environments?

1. In qt_linux_hmi_tester, find the class linuxpreloadingaction.h.Â 
2. Create a similar class to support library preloading in windows.
3. In qt_linux_lib_preload, find qtx11preloadingcontrol class.
4. Create a similar class to "wake up" the OHT at application startup and start OHT installation process.

## How does the injection + preloading process works?

1. The class doing DLL injection before application launching is called LinuxPreloadingAction (extends PreloadingAction) and it is in the HMI Tester. In Linux, it uses the environment variable LD_PRELOAD to set the library to be preloaded before target application launching.

2. The class deploying the OHT services into the target application is QtX11PreloadingControl (extends PreloadingControl) and it is in the Lib Preload. In Linux, it uses QWidget::x11Event in Qt4, or QWidget::nativeEvent in Qt5 to "automatically wake up" and start deploying event consumer and executor.

## If I try to open and build the build_oht_qt_win.pro I get these messages:

    cannot find -lboost_serialization-mgw49-mt-d-1_60
    cannot find -lboost_thread-mgw49-mt-d-1_60
    cannot find -lboost_system-mgw49-mt-d-1_60

You need to correctly reference Boost libraries:

1. in `common/common.pri`, add correct Boost includes at the end of this file.
2. change the name of all includes from `-lboost_system-mgw49-mt-d-1_60` to `-lboost_system-<your-compiler-version>-1_60`. Remember that Boost libraries have to be compiled with the same compiler used by Qt (`mingw` in this case).

## I cannot compile `build_all_*.pro` project

In this case, try to compile projects independently:

1. Compile `qt_*_hmi_tester` project.
2. Compile `qt_*_lib_preload` project.

`*` means the operating system we are building OHT for.


## I am running an application using Qt 4.8 + Embedded Linux without X server (there is QWS from QtEmbedded built in my application instead). Does OHT support this kind of setup?

OHT will support this kind of setup provided that you can "wake up" OHT within your application. With waking up I mean to find an event that is executed at your application launching, so you can handle it and start deploying OHT services.

In the Qt-Linux implementation, the class deploying the OHT services into the target application is QtX11PreloadingControl (extends PreloadingControl) and it is in the Lib Preload. In Linux, it uses QWidget::x11Event in Qt4, or QWidget::nativeEvent in Qt5 to "automatically wake up" and start deploying event consumer and executor.

So, you need to create and adaptation of this class (e.g., QWSPreloadingControl) and:
* either you find a generic Qt4 event that executes at application startup, similar to QWidget::nativeEvent in Qt5
* or you find a QWS event equivalent to QWidget::x11Event in Qt4

### The AUT is crashing and I don't know why. Are there any logs to see what's happening?

Two logs are generated with the standard and error output of the Application Under Test (AUT):
* oht_aut_stdout.log
* oht_aut_stderr.log

They are located in the same directory where the OHT binary is located.
